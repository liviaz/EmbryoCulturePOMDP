\begin_layout Title
Life begins as a POMDP: improving decision making in the IVF clinic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Patient outcomes after in vitro fertilization (IVF) are heavily dependent
 on subjective treatment decisions made by physicians based on limited informati
on.
 Because the optimal outcome of IVF is to achieve a singleton pregnancy,
 physicians often attempt to identify exactly one viable embryo to transfer
 to patients.
 However, embryo viability cannot be observed directly and must instead
 be predicted by a series of morphological assessments.
 In this study, the period of embryo culture between fertilization and transfer
 was modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
 A near-optimal policy was determined for each of two reward functions which
 represent desirable outcomes in clinical situations, and the actions resulting
 from those policies were compared to actions physicians would take in those
 scenarios.
 By combining information from POMDP solutions with human decision-making
 in the IVF clinic, physicians could more reliably choose a treatment plan
 for each patient which reduces the risk of undesirable outcomes and maximizes
 overall pregnancy rates.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current clinical practice of IVF, a patient starts a treatment cycle
 with hormones which stimulate several egg-containing follicles to grow.
 Once the eggs are determined to be sufficiently mature, they are collected
 and fertilized via regular IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI),
 depending on sperm quality.
 The resulting embryos are then incubated overnight and a fertilization
 check is performed the following morning to assess whether fertilization
 actually occured.
 Typically, the majority of eggs collected are able to fertilize successfully
 so the clinicians are then tasked with choosing which and how many embryos
 to transfer back to the patient in hopes of achieving a successful pregnancy.
 The selection of embryos for transfer is a difficult problem because the
 desired outcome is not just for the patient to become pregnant, but also
 to have a 
\shape italic
singleton
\shape default
 pregnancy.
 Multiple gestation pregnancies are associated with significantly higher
 medical costs, risks of complications, and neonatal mortality, so transferring
 too many viable embryos will also lead to a suboptimal outcome.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Typical clinical workflow in IVF.
 After fertilization, clinicians must decide for how long to culture embryos,
 and then which one(s) to transfer back to the patient to maximize her chances
 of a singleton pregnancy.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selecting embryos for transfer requires an assessment of embryo quality
 to predict viability.
 The current gold standard to determine quality is to culture embryos for
 several days after fertilization (typically to the day 3 cleavage stage,
 or to the day 5-6 blastocyst stage), and simply designate those which do
 not arrest as viable.
 Although this method can eliminate many embryos which are not viable from
 consideration for transfer, is also causes significant stress to all embryos
 as extended time in culture can negatively affect patterns of gene expression
 and epigenetic reprogramming.
 Therefore, it is important to balance the information gathered from extra
 time in culture with the stress caused by the culture process itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to viability determination by attrition, clinicians can also
 gather information about viability based on morphological features such
 as cell number, symmetry, and degree of fragmentation.
 These features are highly subjective and only moderately correlated with
 viability, but are noninvasive and easy to perform.
 Recent advances in research have also resulted in new, more accurate assessment
s of viability such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis and time lapse
 imaging.
 These tests can improve prediction over a morphological assessment alone,
 but have varying degrees of invasiveness and cost significantly more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, between the time of fertilization and the time of transfer to
 the patient, clinicians must make a series of decisions regarding which
 assessments of viability to conduct, how long to culture, and which embryos
 to transfer in order to achieve a singleton pregnancy.
 It is possible that by modeling this process as a POMDP, we can come up
 with an optimal decision-making policy to maximize success rates.

Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of embryo development from the time of fertilization check (day
 1) to the last possible culture day (day 5) was modeled as a partially
 observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which includes a set of states
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, actions 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 as well as a transition matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(s'\vert s,a\right)$
\end_inset

, an observation function 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(o\vert s,a\right)$
\end_inset

 and a reward function 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s,a\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
POMDP=\left\{ S,A,\Theta,T,O,R\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Representation of Embryo Culture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The POMDP is represented by the EmbryoCulture type and parameterized by
 the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of embryos which successfully fertilize.
 The status of the embryos in culture is tracked over 5 days, which is typically
 the longest possible time embryologists can culture embryos before they
 must decide which to transfer to the patient.
 Each time step in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Delta t\right)$
\end_inset

 represents 1 day in culture, because embryo morphology is generally assessed
 only once per day by clinical staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
State Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current state of the embryo culture consists of the following variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{l}
EmbryoState=\left\{ n,v,m_{v},m_{nv},d\right\} \\
m_{v}=\left[\#m_{v,poor},\#m_{v,fair},\#m_{v,good}\right]\\
m_{nv}=\left[\#m_{nv,poor},\#m_{nv,fair},\#m_{nv,good}\right]
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the EmbryoState structure, n is the number of embryos in culture, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the number of those which are viable, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the 3x1 morphology vector containing the number of viable embryos with
 poor/fair/good morphology, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{nv}$
\end_inset

 is the 3x1 morphology vector containing the number of nonviable embryos
 with poor/fair/good morphology, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the day in culture.
 Because the embryos can be cultured for up to 5 days, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 must be an integer from 1 to 6 (
\begin_inset Formula $day=6$
\end_inset

 represents a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

done
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state where the embryos have already been transferred or discarded).
 The size of the state space is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vert S\vert=6n\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{(i+1)(i+2)(n-i+1)(n-i+2)}{4}
\]

\end_inset

There are 6 possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, and the term inside the sum represents the number of possible arrangements
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{nv}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 viable and 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-v)$
\end_inset

 nonviable embryos for 
\begin_inset Formula $v=i.$
\end_inset

 An alternate representation of the state space was initially explored containin
g the viability status and morphology of each individual embryo in culture.
 However, this resulted in a state space of size 
\begin_inset Formula $50^{n}$
\end_inset

, which was significantly more difficult to deal with computationally and
 was abandoned in favor of the representation described here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Action Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actions available to the embryologist during embryo culture are represented
 by the following variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
EmbryoAction=\left\{ a,tr\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cc}
a\in\left\{ CC,B,TR,D\right\}  & tr\in1:n\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the EmbryoAction structure, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 represents the action taken by the embryologist, where CC = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continue culture,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 B = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biopsy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 TR = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer to patient,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and D = 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

discard all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If action TR is chosen, then the 
\begin_inset Formula $tr$
\end_inset

 variable represents the number of embryos to transfer.
 These are chosen based on morphology, regardless of whether they are viable
 or nonviable, because the embryologist can only observe morphological informati
on and not viability directly.
 If there are many embryos with equal morphology, then a random subset of
 size 
\begin_inset Formula $tr$
\end_inset

 is chosen from among them.
 The size of the action space for an EmbryoCulture POMDP with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 embryos is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vert A\vert=3+n
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Observation Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variables observed by the embryologist are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
EmbryoObservation=\left\{ n,m,d\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the EmbryoObservation structure, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 represents the number of embryos in culture, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 represents the 3x1 morphology vector of all embryos in culture (because
 the embryologist does not know which are viable and which are nonviable),
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 represents the day in culture.
 The observation depends on the state as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{l}
observation.n=state.n\\
observation.m=state.m_{v}+state.m_{nv}\\
observation.d=state.d
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The size of the observation space is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vert O\vert=6\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 6 possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and the fraction represents the number of possible morphology vectors
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 total embryos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Transition Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 total embryos which we start with in culture, typically only a number 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 of these will be viable, and this number may decrease over time.
 Although a particular embryo may start out as viable at day 1, on each
 subsequent day it may experience a failure in chromosome segregation or
 some other event which could render it nonviable.
 Once an embryo becomes nonviable, it will stay that way forever as chromosomal
 abnormalities hardly ever revert to normal.
 Therefore, we can represent the viability of a single embryo 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 over time as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{l}
e\in\left\{ viable,nonviable\right\} \\
p\left(e(t+1)=viable\vert e(t)=viable\right)=p_{v}\\
p\left(e(t+1)=viable\vert e(t)=nonviable\right)=0
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{v}$
\end_inset

 used in this project was 0.9 based on findings in the literature that only
 around 50-60% of fertilized embryos at day 1 can successfully develop to
 day 5.
 If we have a group of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 viable embryos, then the number of viable embryos at the next day in culture
 can be represented by a sum of Bernoulli random variables each with parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{v}$
\end_inset

, which is a random variable with the Binomial distribution and parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{v}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(v(t+1)\right)\sim Binomial\left(v(t),p_{v}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 embryos in culture also have a morphological parameter associated with
 them which is visible to the embryologist.
 Although morphology is generally a poor predictor of embryo viability,
 viable embryos have been shown to have slightly better morphological scores
 than nonviable embryos.
 The morphology of embryo 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 in culture at day 1 is therefore initialized as follows (where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{v}$
\end_inset

 represents the case of a viable embryo and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{nv}$
\end_inset

 represents a nonviable embryo):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m(e)\in\left\{ poor,fair,good\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\left(e\left(t=1\right)\right)\sim\begin{cases}
Binomial(2,p_{n,v}) & e_{v}\\
Binomial(2,p_{n,nv}) & e_{nv}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reflect morphology distributions found in published studies, a value
 of 0.8 was used for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n,nv}$
\end_inset

 and a value of 0.9 was used for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n.v}$
\end_inset

 so that viable embryos would have slightly better starting morphological
 scores than nonviable embryos on average.
 At each time step after fertilization, an embryo may retain its morphology,
 or it may experience a reduction either from 
\begin_inset Formula $good\to fair$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $fair\to poor$
\end_inset

 (but not from 
\begin_inset Formula $good\to poor$
\end_inset

).
 Although nonviable embryos may continue to develop normally and retain
 their morphological status for several days after fertilization, they do
 have a slightly higher change of experiencing a reduction in morphology
 compared to viable embryos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(m(e(t+1))=m(e(t))\right)=\begin{cases}
p_{n,v} & e_{v}\\
p_{n.nv} & e_{nv}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, at each time step, each embryo will retain its morphology with
 a certain probability based on whether it is viable or not.
 Otherwise, its morphology will be lowered by one level.
 To calculate the transition probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 from EmbryoState 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}\to s_{t+1}$
\end_inset

, the following procedure was used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.v<s_{t+1}.v$
\end_inset

, then some 
\begin_inset Formula $x=(s_{t}.v-s_{t+1}.v)$
\end_inset

 viable embryos must have become nonviable from 
\begin_inset Formula $t\to t+1$
\end_inset

.
 Remove the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 embryos with the poorest morphology values from 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.m_{v}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 embryos with those same morphology values to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}.m_{nv}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.m_{v}$
\end_inset

 transitioned into 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}.m_{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Start with embryos with lowest morphology in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t+1}.m_{v}$
\end_inset

 and match those to embryos with lowest morphology in 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.m_{v}$
\end_inset

.
 For each embryo, multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n,v}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-p_{n,v}\right)$
\end_inset

 based on whether that embryo maintained its morphology or went down a level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat step 3 but for 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}.m_{nv}\to s_{t+1}.m_{nv}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{v}^{v-x}\left(1-p_{v}\right)^{x}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 embryos became nonviable and 
\begin_inset Formula $v-x$
\end_inset

 remained viable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Reward Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reward function was designed to encourage the transfer of a single viable
 embryo to the patient.
 A high positive reward was provided for transferring exactly one viable
 embryo (and any number of nonviable embryos) to the patient.
 A smaller reward was provided for transferring two viable embryos, and
 no reward (or a negative reward) was provided for transferring 3 or more
 viable embryos.
 These rewards reflect the strong preference that most patients have towards
 becoming pregnant vs not, but also the preference to just have one baby
 rather than twins or more.
 A strong negative reward was provided for transferring only nonviable embryos,
 as this would represent the patient not becoming pregnant, or potentially
 experiencing a miscarriage.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it is likely that there are no viable embryos, the embryologist also
 has an option to discard all the embryos and avoid wasting the patient's
 time with a transfer that fails to result in a pregnancy.
 There is a small negative reward for discarding all embryos if none are
 viable, and a large negative reward for discarding all embryos if one or
 more is viable.
 This setup incentivizes discarding all embryos if none are viable, but
 transferring at least one embryo if one or more are viable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there is a small negative reward for choosing to do nothing (continue
 culture), but by the 5th time step, the embryos must be either transferred
 or discarded because culture cannot continue any further.
 Once a transfer or discard (or biopsy) action has been performed, the embryo
 culture is put in a terminal state (regardless of which day the transfer
 or discard was performed) and no further rewards can be obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Solution Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The embryo culture scenario was represented in Julia using the POMDPs package.
 Solutions were obtained using the SARSOP package for scenarios with up
 to 3 embryos, and a discount factor of 1 was used to apply equal importance
 to rewards at all time steps.
 The following reward functions were tried to reflect different clinically
 desirable outcomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
R1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prioritize transfer of single viable embryo, strongly discourage transfer
 of no viable embryos.
 For number of viable embryos transferred 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left[0,1,2,3+\right]$
\end_inset

, the reward given is 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left[-80,80,0,0\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This represents an ideal reward scenario that many IVF clinics would like
 to follow (avoid twins or higher gestation pregnancies due to medical risks).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
R2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prioritize pregnancy with more tolerance to failed cycle (transfer of no
 viable embryos).
 For number of viable embryos transferred 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left[0,1,2,3+\right]$
\end_inset

, the reward given is 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left[-40,40,20,0\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This represents the reward scenario typically used in IVF clinics (where
 many patients just want to get pregnant rather than not due to the time
 and money they are investing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the policies obtained from running the SARSOP algorithm on the reward
 profiles mentioned above, 160 simulations were performed.
 Outcome information was recorded regarding the reward obtained, the day
 the transfer (or discard) was performed, and the number of embryos transferred
 .
 The simulations sampled a wide range of starting states by varying the
 number of viable embryos in culture from 0 to 3, and by randomly generating
 the starting morphology distributions of the viable and nonviable embryos.
 In some scenarios, nonviable embryos had the same starting morphology as
 the viable embryos, and in other scenarios they had on average poorer starting
 morphology.
 Average rewards over 500 simulations and 5 time steps are displayed in
 Table 1 and were found to be approximately the same for both policies.

\begin_layout Standard
The average number of embryos transferred over all simulations is shown
 in the left panel of Figure 3, split by the starting number of viable embryos
 in the simulation.
 In the first reward scenario (R1 = [-80,80,0,0]), the number of embryos
 transferred increases as the number of viable embryos in culture increases.
 However, the trend appears to level off when there are 3 viable embryos
 present in culture, as this scenario penalizes the transfer of too many
 viable embryos.
 For the second reward scenario (R2 = [-40,40,20,0]), the correlation between
 the number of viable embryos in culture and the number of embryos transferred
 is much stronger.
 This policy makes sense because there are still rewards to be had even
 when 2 viable embryos are transferred, so the policy has no reason to avoid
 transferring too many viable embryos.

The outcomes of the two policies in the left panel of Figure 3 are shown
 in the right panel of the same figure.
 As expected, the policy derived from the second reward function R2 results
 in a much higher percentage of cases where 2 or more viable embryos are
 transferred to the patient (and thus over double the rate of multiple gestation
 pregnancies compared to the policy derived from R1).
 However, the R2 policy also results in many fewer cases of failed transfers
 (transfers with no viable embryos) compared to the R1 policy.
 Although the singleton pregnancy rate resulting from R1 is higher, the
 overall pregnancy rate from R2 is higher.
 It is clearly difficult to optimize for only singleton pregnancy outcomes
 in IVF, likely due to the poor predictive value of choosing embryos based
 on morphology alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between observed morphology and type of discard/transfer
 action taken was also explored.
 Although the optimal action depends on the belief state and not directly
 on the observation (some observations could lead to more than one action
 depending on belief state), there was a clear correlation between morphology
 distribution and number of embryos transferred.

 action (discard all) was generally chosen when there were no observed embryos

 Because nonviable embryos have a much higher chance of experiencing a reduction
 in morphology from one day to the next, a lack of good morphology embryos
 likely indicates a lack of viable embryos.

 actions (transfer top 2 or 3 embryos according to morphology, respectively)
 were chosen when there were embryos with both good and poor morphology
 present.
 It is likely that this action was chosen because the good morphology embryos
 were most likely to be viable, and transferring additional embryos of lower
 quality could compensate in the event that the good morphology embryos
 were actually not viable.
 The

 action was generally chosen when there were only fair and good quality

 Because in this scenario it is likely that all observed embryos are viable,
 only one embryo is chosen for transfer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The policy reflected in Figure 4 matches up fairly well with physician actions
 in the IVF clinic; although generally physicians strive for single embryo
 transfer, many patients have only poor or fair morphology embryos available
 and it is difficult to choose a single viable embryo based on morphology
 alone.
 In these cases, physicians may choose 2 or more embryos for transfer to
 the patient, which is reflected in the policy derived here.

The action chosen by the policy depends heavily on the observed morphology
 distribution at that time step.
 In general, only one embryo is transferred when there are mostly good morpholog
y embryos observed, and more are transferred when there are poor and fair
 morphology embryos present as well.
 If there are no good morphology embryos present, then usually they are
 all discarded.

Discussion

\begin_layout Standard
The modeling of embryo culture after IVF as a POMDP in this paper represents
 a first attempt at reproducing and optimizing the decision-making process
 physicians must repeat every day in order to maximize benefits to patients.
 The policy derived from application of the SARSOP algorithm to a POMDP
 with 3 embryos appeared to match reasonably well with the policy currently
 practiced in the IVF clinic.
 When a patient has embryos with mostly good morphology, physicians feel
 comfortable conducting single embryo transfer because it is likely they
 are transferring a viable embryo.
 When a patient has embryos with mixed or poor morphology, physicians often
 transfer more in the hopes that at least one will be viable (and take the
 risk that the patient will end up with twins or triplets).
 Rarely, physicians discard all embryos in culture if they have mostly poor
 morphology to avoid wasting the patient's time in a failed transfer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By modeling the process of embryo culture as a POMDP, it could become possible
 to vary the reward function according to desired clincal outcomes (or a
 specific patient's wishes), or modify the transition function according
 to statistics observed in the literature, and re-calculate a near-optimal
 policy.
 Physicians could then compare their intended actions to those recommended
 by the POMDP policy, and possibly receive help in making decisions if they
 are unsure how to proceed.
 Still, the policy calculated by the solution algorithm is highly dependent
 on the specific reward function chosen, which is based on subjective human
 assessments about the value of various clinical outcomes.
 For POMDPs to become practical for clinical use, the

rewards

 given for clinical outcomes will have to be very carefully tuned, and physician
s will have to figure out how to balance the actions recommended by the
 calculated to policy with their own intuition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also a few limintations specific to the POMDP developed in this
 paper, the first of which is that only a simplified version of the embryo
 culture was represented.
 In reality, there are more types of morphological grades than the good/fair/poo
r used here, which would add significantly to the state space and further
 complicate the transition model.
 There are also several information-gathering actions which the physician
 can take, all of which have different levels of reliability.
 These include (but are not limited to) : gathering time lapse parameters
 which can give a moderately accurate prediction of viability, and performing
 a biopsy (preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS) which can yield highly
 accurate information about each embryo's chromosomal status.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computation time can also easily become an issue when modeling typical
 clinical scenarios.
 In the embryo culture POMDP, it took around 5 minutes to write out a pomdpx
 file and run the SARSOP agorithm for 3 embryos in culture.
 Although the state space was ultimately reduced to polynomial in size by
 carefully choosing the problem representation, it still took over 1 hour
 to find a solution for 4 embryos in culture, and over 12 hours for 5 embryos
 in culture.
 Because many patients have 10 or more embryos, some more effort will have
 to be directed toward fast, practical methods for representing and solving
 the POMDP of embryos in culture.
