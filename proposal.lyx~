Life begins as a POMDP: improving decision making in the IVF clinic 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure of 
\shape italic
in vitro
\shape default
 fertilization (IVF) relies heavily on subjective treatment decisions which
 are made based on limited information.
 For this project, I propose to model early embryo development as a partially
 observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and determine an optimal sequence
 of actions for a given set of embryos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Problem Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current clinical practice of IVF, a patient starts a treatment cycle
 with hormones which stimulate several egg-containing follicles to grow.
 Once the eggs are determined to be sufficiently mature, they are collected
 and fertilized via regular IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI),
 depending on sperm quality.
 The resulting embryos are then incubated overnight and a fertilization
 check is performed the following morning to assess whether fertilization
 actually occured.
 Typically, the majority of eggs collected are able to fertilize successfully
 so the clinicians are then tasked with choosing which and how many embryos
 to transfer back to the patient in hopes of achieving a successful pregnancy.
 The selection of embryos for transfer is a difficult problem because the
 desired outcome is not just for the patient to become pregnant, but also
 to have a 
\shape italic
singleton
\shape default
 pregnancy.
 Multiple gestation pregnancies are associated with significantly higher
 medical costs, risks of complications, and neonatal mortality, so transferring
 too many viable embryos will also lead to a suboptimal outcome.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Typical clinical workflow in IVF.
 After fertilization, clinicians must decide for how long to culture embryos,
 and then which one(s) to transfer back to the patient to maximize her chances
 of a singleton pregnancy.

\begin_layout Standard
Selecting embryos for transfer requires an assessment of embryo quality
 to predict viability.
 The current gold standard to determine quality is to culture embryos for
 several days after fertilization (typically to the day 3 cleavage stage,
 or to the day 5-6 blastocyst stage), and simply designate those which do
 not arrest and which survive as viable.
 Although this method can eliminate many embryos which are not viable from
 consideration for transfer, is also causes significant stress to all embryos
 as extended time in culture can negatively affect patterns of gene expression
 and epigenetic reprogramming.
 Therefore, it is important to balance the information gathered from extra
 time in culture with the stress caused by the culture process itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to viability determination by attrition, clinicians can also
 gather information about viability based on morphological features such
 as cell number, symmetry, and degree of fragmentation.
 These features are highly subjective and only moderately correlated with
 viability, but are noninvasive and easy to perform.
 Recent advances in research have also resulted in new, more accurate assessment
s of viability such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis and time lapse
 imaging.
 These tests can improve prediction over a morphological assessment alone,
 but have varying degrees of invasiveness and cost significantly more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, between the time of fertilization and the time of transfer to
 the patient, clinicians must make a series of decisions regarding which
 assessments of viability to conduct, how long to culture, and which embryos
 to transfer in order to achieve a singleton pregnancy.
 It is possible that by modeling this process as a POMDP, we can come up
 with an optimal decision-making policy to maximize success rates.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of embryo development from the time of fertilization check to
 the time of transfer will be modeled as a POMDP, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If a patient starts with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 fertilized embryos, there will be ground truth viability information for
 all embryos represented as an 
\begin_inset Formula $nx1$
\end_inset

 vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The
\series bold
 state space
\series default
 describes each embryo's internal state with two parameters per embryo.
 The first of these two refers to the developmental status of the embryo,
 which is either arrested or still developing.
 The second parameter refers to the embryo's probability of arresting each
 day, which is related to its ultimate viability but also to its time in
 culture and also other random factors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\series bold
action space
\series default
 consists of decisions the clinician may make each day.
 These consist of transferring one or more embryos, ordering additional
 viability tests, or simply doing nothing and waiting another day in culture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\series bold
observation space
\series default
 consists of embryo morphological data, and it may also contain the results
 of optional viability tests ordered by the clinician.
 The 
\series bold
observation model
\series default
 will account for the fact that clinician assessments of morphology and
 arrest are highly subjective and user-dependent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The
\series bold
 reward model 
\series default
will give positive rewards for transferring viable embryos, with a significant
 bonus for transferring only one viable embryo.
 It will give negative rewards for every additional day spent in culture,
 each additional viability test ordered, with a large negative penalty for
 transferring no viable embryos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The
\series bold
 transition model
\series default
 will advance the state of each embryo one time step based on its developmental
 status and its probability of arrest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test out this approach, I have a data set from research which contains
 data on morphology, developmental stage, time lapse parameters, and chromosomal
 status for 50-60 embryos.
 Since solving a POMDP may require a large amount of data, I am also considering
 simulating a much larger data set based on published statistics on human
 embryo viability and morphology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Outcome Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The success of this approach will be measured by (a) the percentage of cycles
 which result in the transfer of at least one viable embryo, and (b) the
 percentage of cycles which result in the transfer of exactly one viable
 embryo.
 In IVF today, over 35% of pregnancies represent twins or higher order multiples
, mainly due to the practice of transferring several embryos at once.
 For this reason, a huge percentage of IVF babies are born prematurely,
 have low birth weight, and are at increased risks of developmental delays.
 If this model is able to increase the rate of singleton pregnancies beyond
 65%, it could eventually enable clinicians to improve their pregnancy rates,
 reduce complications, and even reduce the overall cost of IVF for their
 patients.
